**COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Python**

COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Python
This project explores the relationship between COVID-19 infection rates and various life factors like GDP per capita, Social Support, and Freedom using real-world datasets.

📌 Project Overview
We used time-series COVID-19 confirmed case data from Johns Hopkins University and combined it with the World Happiness Report to understand how happiness-related indicators might correlate with the spread of the virus in different countries.

✅ Key Skills Demonstrated
Data cleaning and aggregation using pandas

Dataset merging based on common keys (country name)

Calculating infection rate metrics

Exploratory data analysis and visualization using seaborn and matplotlib

Using np.log() to scale and normalize data for better visualization

📊 Key Insights
Countries with stronger social support and freedom to make life choices tend to have lower maximum infection rates.

GDP per capita showed weak correlation, but a trend is still observable in log scale.

Log transformation was useful to handle skewed data distributions in infection rates.
